Frequently used Kinematics and Dynamics Codes

The main idea behind creating this repositor is to amass optimized codes of frequently used kinematics and dynamics function of open chain manipulators. Please note that all the codes are based on screw theoretic formulation of kinematics and dynamics as described in Murrey, Lee, Shastry book (A Mathematical Introduction to Robotics) written in MATLAB. 

Although most of the functions come with a brief descriptions of their own, I intent to write simple applications using them in future.
